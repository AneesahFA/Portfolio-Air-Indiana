    <h2>Artifact: Air Indiana Chatbot</h2>
    <div class="artifact-box">
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Air Indiana Chatbot Project</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To learn how to design, develop, and deploy a conversational AI chatbot tailored to airline customer service needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This chatbot simulates a virtual assistant for Air Indiana, guiding users through flight inquiries, booking steps, and general support. The chatbot responds intelligently to user input using ChatGPT’s built-in conversational capabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Live Demo:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67cc7ca7566c8191a3b99cd54b7f51d1-ai-chatbot" target="_blank">Try the Air Indiana Chatbot</a></p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> I used ChatGPT to create and train the chatbot by feeding it sample questions and evaluating its responses. I refined its training data by asking ChatGPT how it would respond to various user inputs, effectively teaching it how to handle common airline-related inquiries. The chatbot uses its own AI capabilities along with the contextual guidance I provided to deliver accurate and engaging responses.</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> ChatGPT, prompt design, testing iterations, GitHub Pages for portfolio deployment</p>
      <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Demonstrates my ability to build AI-driven user experiences, reflecting both technical and soft skills like communication and iteration.</p>
      <p><strong>Unique Value:</strong> This project shows how AI and user-driven data training can be combined to enhance digital customer service in the airline industry.</p>
      <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Aligned with learning objectives in software development, AI, and digital transformation.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This artifact was tailored for a regional airline audience focused on improving digital customer experience. I learned how to guide an AI model (ChatGPT) using sample data and refine responses for natural, useful conversation. Feedback from my team helped me simplify flows and align the bot with real-world user expectations. This project showed me the power of human-AI collaboration, and how prompt design plays a critical role in AI performance. I also gained hands-on experience in creating assets, presenting value propositions, and publishing work in a professional format using GitHub Pages.</p>
